# Photo Caption

Photo Caption is a command line script to take a photo with a descriptive file name (`Yalta Conference; Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin.jpg`) and adds the name to the bottom of the image as a caption.

* Note: semi-colons (`;`) are used to split new lines in the caption.

## Usage
```
$ python photo-caption [List of files]
```
